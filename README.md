# Language Learning Process

Largely gotten from the below video and previous experience, this repository summarizes a process of learning or getting familiar with a programming language.

## Basic Language Constructs
1. variable deceleration 
2. Printing to terminal/commandline
3. operators 
4. conditional statements (if, if/else etc.)
5. loops (for, while etc.)
6. input/output (accepting user input mostly)
7. files (reading from and writing to files)

## Intermediate stuff
8. functions
9. classes
10. decorators

## Beginner Exercises (increasing difficulty)
The below exercises can be used to get familiar with the syntax of a language and can be done with the various level of user interactivity. Write a program that does the below:
1. Calculate the circumference of a circle - 2*PI*r
2. Implement and use Pythagoras theorem in a program i.e x^2 = y^2 + z^2
3. Convert a given temprature unit from Celcius to Farenheight or from Farenheight to Celcius depending on the user input
4. A calculator that takes two inputs and an operator and performs the associated mathematical operation e.g inputs '6', '4' and '+' would output 10 as 6+4=10. This can be done with and without using functions/procedures.
